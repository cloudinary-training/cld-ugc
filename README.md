# Environment Setup

### Install Node.js and NPM
 - You will need to install Node.js on your machine, version 10 or higher.
 - Installing Node.js will also install npm, the package manager for Node.js.


#### Mac Users:
üç∫ Using Homebrew:

```console
$ brew install node
```

#### Windows Users:
[Node Download for Windows](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

#### Verify Node/NPM install:

```console
$ node --version
v18.18.1

$ npm --version
9.8.1
```

### Choose an IDE or Use Text Editor:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (Recommended)
- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
- [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/)

### Download this Repository:

[UGC GitHub Repository](https://github.com/cloudinary-training/cld-ugc)

- Node scripts for this module are located in the  `/moderation`, `/foldering`, `/transformations`, `/upload` `/upload-presets`, `/upload-widget`  and `/transformations` directories
- Assets are located in `/assets` directory
- Run code from root directory 

### Account Setup and Credentials:

1. If you don't have one already, create a free Cloudinary account at: https://www.cloudinary.com/signup.

2. Navigate to the Dashboard. Copy the `CLOUDINARY_URL` into your clipboard (see yellow arrow).

![Dashboard](./assets/environment_variable.png)

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. Paste the CLOUDINARY_URL environment variable into your `.env` file.

There should be one line of code in your .env file, which should look like this:

```console
CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://YOUR_API_KEY:YOUR_API_SECRET@YOUR_CLOUD_NAME
```
- Key: CLOUDINARY_URL
- Value: cloudinary://API_KEY:API_SECRET@CLOUD_NAME

Doing this step properly is essential, as it will let Cloudinary know who you are and provide access to your cloud.
### Run Code: Install Node Libraries


```console
npm i
```
(You will be using the `cloudinary` and the `dotenv` libraries.)

### Run Code: Test Credentials

```console
node testCredentials.js
```

The output should look like this:
```console
your Cloud Name
your API Key
```

- Your API_SECRET is part of your CLOUDINARY_URL
- Remember to always keep your API_SECRET a secret!
  - This is why we programmed testCredentials.js to only output your cloud name and API Key (no need to keep these two credentials private)


### Run Code: Optional Upload Check

```console
node upload/local-upload.js
```
(You can optionally run the local image upload script to make sure you see the asset appear in your cloud)

### Introduction to Material:

There is an accompanying [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nEprgb7jLQ-g7r9vU9DvAWpjhXBLckw_3n3KWrf78L8/edit#slide=id.g290ff1d21f2_1_2898) that will walk you through the following topics related to UGC.

- First we review where one might see UGC in the wild
- Then, in the context of a food delivery app, we discuss ways Cloudinary can help with the management of said UGC
